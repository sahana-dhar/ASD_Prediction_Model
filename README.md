# ASD_Prediction_Model

This project uses public datasets (ABIDE I/II) to explore predictive modeling for autism diagnosis and symptom severity using neuroimaging and behavioral data.

## Objectives
- Build baseline models to classify ASD vs. TD (typical development)
- Explore emotion and motor trait contributions using brain data
- Predict continuous symptom scores like SRS and ADOS

## Structure
- `data/` – Raw + processed files (not committed to Git)
- `notebooks/` – EDA and exploratory experiments
- `scripts/` – Loading, preprocessing, and training pipelines
- `results/` – Visualizations and model outputs
